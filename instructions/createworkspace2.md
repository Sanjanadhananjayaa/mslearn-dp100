1. **It is necessary that after completing this exercise, then proceed to the next one**.

1. After signing into the azure portal using the credentials provided in the environment details page, Search for **Resource Groups** in the search bar.

1. You will find the **dp-100-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group. Click on **dp-100-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** to find the resources for the lab.

1. Under **compute instances** you can find **notebook<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**. Click on **Jupyter** (make sure to click on **Jupyter** not **JupyterLab**) to run the notebook to perform the lab. A lot of data science and machine learning experimentation is performed by running code in *notebooks*. Your compute instance includes fully featured Python notebook environments (*Jupyter* and *JuypyterLab*) that you can use for extensive work.

1. Terminal will open in a new window, Enter the following commands to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:

    ```bash
    cd Users
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-dp100
    ```

1. After running the commands you will get the output as shown below image. Then close the terminal window browser tab and go back to the jupyter window.

1. Click **&#8635;** to refresh the view and verify that a new **Users/mslearn-dp100** folder has been created. This folder contains multiple **.ipynb** notebook files.

   > **Tip**: To run a code cell in the notebook, select the cell you want to run and then use the **&#9655;** button to run it.

1. If asked to provide **compute cluster** while running the notebook, then please provide compute cluster as **aml-compute**.

1. Click on **Next** to continue to the next module in this lab.

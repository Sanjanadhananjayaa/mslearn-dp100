# Work with Data

## Overview

Although it's fairly common to work with data on their local file system, in an enterprise environment it can be more effective to store the data in a central location where multiple data scientists and machine learning engineers can access it.

In this exercise, you'll explore *datastores* and *datasets*, which are the primary objects used to abstract data access in Azure Machine Learning.

## Open Jupyter

While you can use the **Notebooks** page in Azure Machine Learning studio to run notebooks, it's often more productive to use a more fully-featured notebook development environment like *Jupyter*.

> **Tip**: Jupyter Notebook is a commonly used open-source tool for data science. You can refer to the [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) if you are unfamiliar with it.

1. In the LabVM browser open Azure Machine Learning Studio(https://ml.azure.com). If prompted, log in using the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** tab. View the **Compute** page for your workspace.

    **Note**: If you get **Welcome to the studio** page when you login, Select **Subscription** and **Machine Learning workspace** available in the drop down then click on **Get Started**.

2. On the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance if it is not already running.

3. When the compute instance is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab. Be sure to open *Jupyter* and not *JupyterLab*.

## Work with data stores and datasets

In this exercise, the code to work with data is provided in a notebook.

1. In the Jupyter home page, browse to the **Users/mslearn-dp100** folder where you cloned the notebook repository. 

2. Click on **Work with Data** (06 - Work with Data.ipynb) notebook to open the new tab.

3. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn. To run each cell select and click on **Run** on the menu.

> **Note**: Kindly wait after you run each code cell until the output for the code is shown and CPU utilization is 0% else the succeeding code cells will not get executed.

4. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.
